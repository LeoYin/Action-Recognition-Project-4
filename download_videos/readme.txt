This script will attempt to download a list of Youtube videos using the youtube-dl utility.

It is highly recommended to download the latest version of youtube-dl from the official website:
https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/download.html


If you don't mind some missing videos, you can also install an older version from your package system:
apt-get install youtube-dl
yum install youtube-dl
